The goal of the website is to help users find popular videos that have been shared on Twitter. The focus is on the search feature, which can look for either a username or a tag.

My job was to create an identity analogous to Vine, as well as an interface to view these videos. A separate developer was in charge of writing the necessary front end code.

For this project, I provided a <span class="highlight">vector logo, site mockups, and a CSS style guide for various web elements</span>.
