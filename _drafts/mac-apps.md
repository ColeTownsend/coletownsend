Here is a list of apps that I use on a day to day basis organized based on how I use them. If you're new to Mac and OSX you may find some of these useful. If you aren't you may be suprised to find that a few may help you.

###### Text Editing
* [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
  * This covers my needs for notes, markdown, and the like. If it's not a particularly important piece of writing, I'll do it in ST2.
* [Mou](http://mouapp.com/)
  * Rarely use Mou, but its a lightweight alternative to ST2 or Writer Pro, and can post to Tumblr.

###### Graphic Design
* [Sketch 3](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sketch/id852320343?mt=12)
  * It's fast. It's vector. It has some incredible plugins. Its 49.99. 'Nuff said. This app is amazing for UI and web design work. It has text styles, graphic styles, and layer synchronization (symbol sync).
* [Icon Slate](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/icon-slate/id439697913?mt=12)
  * Perfect for packaging up icon sets for anything.
* [Pixel Winch](http://www.ricciadams.com/projects/pixel-winch)
  * This is a life saver and automatically measures distances. Not 100% accurate, but has it right 95% of the time.
* [Napkin](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/napkin-concise-image-annotation/id581789185?mt=12)
  * Sometimes, but rarely use this for speccing my work. It has some measuring capabilities but definitely isn't worth the price.
* [InBoard](http://inboardapp.com/)
  * I use this to take screen captures of websites and organize any inspiration I find. It doesn't compress anything though so it tends to take up a lot of space.
* [ImageOptim](http://imageoptim.com/)
  * Saves a ton of space and optimizes images for the web. Compression without loss.
* [Paparazzi](http://derailer.org/paparazzi/)
  * Capture full website pages. If you drag and drop into Sketch, it vectorizes the site. It's not 100% on vectorizing sites but it's pretty darn good.
* [Frank DeLoupe](http://www.jumpzero.com/frank/)
  * Awesome color picker that syncs with Photoshop. Could easily be replace by [Sip](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/sip/id507257563?mt=12).

###### Development
* [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
  * great plugins, awesome UI packages for syntax highlighting
* [CakeBrew](https://www.cakebrew.com/)
  * Keep all your homebrew packages up to date. A nice GUI for those less code-inclined
* [hotkeyEVE](http://www.hotkey-eve.com/)
  * a notification tells you the keyboard shortcut if you perform an action that has one
* [Codekit 3](https://incident57.com/codekit/)
  * This is stellar. I find myself using it less and less as I get more proficient in Terminal though. Great for those less comfortable with programming.
* [Github](https://mac.github.com/link)
  * Easy GUI for looking at Diffs and reverting. Sometimes a bit buggy.
* [TextExpander](http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html)
  * Awesome for everything, really. Saves so much time. I use it for email addresses.

###### OSX Maintenance, Default Replacements
* [AppZapper](http://www.appzapper.com/)
  * great for eradicating traces of apps
* [Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/mac/)
  * the best client for twitter.
* [Copy](https://copy.com?r=9u7hOJ)
  * One of the best storage clients in terms of space per price. I have 40GB for free.
