### Insouciance — a relaxed and calm state.
I pride myself in my ability to stay calm, to stay in the moment. This applies to design, to running, to living. My name is Cole Townsend, and I am a designer.

I  also study Art History at Williams College. I like chemex coffee, running, and napping — in that order. I think programming is cool, but don't actually program that much. I'm always trying to learn new things, though. XCode and iOS development are on my shortlist.

I am currently {{site.data.work_status}} for work, but I always reply to emails. <br> <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;%63%6F%6C%65%40%74%77%6E%73%6E%64%2E%63%6F">Let's talk</a>.

I am taking on new work! <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;%63%6F%6C%65%40%74%77%6E%73%6E%64%2E%63%6F">Let's get in touch</a>.
