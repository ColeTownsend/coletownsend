### _Insouciant_ — a relaxed and calm state.
I pride myself in my ability to stay calm, to stay in the moment. This applies to design, to running, to living. My name is Cole Townsend, and I am a designer.

I  also study Art History at Williams College. I like chemex coffee, running, and napping — in that order. I think programming is cool, but don't actually program that much. I'm always trying to learn new things, though. XCode and iOS development are on my shortlist.

I am currently {{site.data.work_status}} for work, but I always reply to emails. <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;%63%6F%6C%65%40%74%77%6E%73%6E%64%2E%63%6F">Let's talk</a>.

{%else %} 
I am taking on new work! <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;%63%6F%6C%65%40%74%77%6E%73%6E%64%2E%63%6F">Let's get in touch</a>.

###### Elsewhere
I write about all sorts of things, often design on my [journal]({{ site.url }}/journal). I chat about my day and useful things I find on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}). I show off my latest work on [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/coletownsend). You can find my open source projects, and this site, on [Github](http://github.com/coletownsend).
