### I create visual solutions with _personality_.
My name is Cole Townsend, and I design. I am fascinated by the process and result of creating aesthetic solutions to problems. I  also study Art History at Williams College<!-- , complemented with a healthy serving of Art Studio and Cross Country -->.
