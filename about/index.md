### I create visual solutions with _personality_.
My name is Cole Townsend, and I am a designer. I love the process and result of creating aesthetic solutions to problems. I  also study Art History at Williams College<!-- , complemented with a healthy serving of Art Studio and Cross Country -->. I like chemex coffee, running, and napping â€” in that order. I think programming is cool, but don't actually program that much. I'm always trying to learn new things, though. XCode and iOS development are on my shortlist.

I am taking on new work! <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;%63%6F%6C%65%40%74%77%6E%73%6E%64%2E%63%6F">Let's get in touch</a>.
