        <p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3A1K280y3H2Z3j1I0N3Q/Screen%20Shot%202013-03-30%20at%201.04.jpg"></p>

<p>My first step was some minor <span class="caps">UX</span> tweaking. I didn&#8217;t want to radically change the site; it&#8217;s relatively intuitive to use as I am familiar with CloudApp, Dropbox, and numerous other cloud based services. One thing I noticed was that there were many different functions on the viewing page. When I was revising the viewing page, I wanted to clean it up. My goal was to make the primary function of each page very&nbsp;clear.</p>

<h2>Viewer</h2>

<p>I started with the viewer itself. There was too much going on, as you can see in the crowded image above. I stripped it down to just navigation arrows and a full screen mode. As a user of many cloud apps, I know that I&#8217;ve never used many features from the viewer itself. The navbar provided me with what I needed in an unobtrusive&nbsp;way.</p>

<h3>Document&nbsp;Viewer</h3>

<p>I wanted to mimic the functions of Google Doc Viewer and Preview. The current functionality is fine, but it is not accessible. It requires flash and is a bit slow to respond. I found myself frustrated as I scrolled through a longer pdf. The scrolling isn&#8217;t smooth — it catches frequently. Additionally, the cursor hand moves at a slower speed in the doc viewer than it does out of it. This isn&#8217;t intuitive and can confuse users. Although I can&#8217;t reflect these changes in my visual representation, it is something I would address with the dev&nbsp;team.</p>

<p>Specifically for the visuals, I aimed to minimize what was going on in the document viewer. I feel that it&#8217;s better to directly be able to influence specifically which page is viewed, rather than clicking through each one&nbsp;individually.</p>

<h3>Video&nbsp;Viewer</h3>

<p>I wish I could show an example of the video viewer. Unfortunately it was not included in the free version, a download was necessary for free users. Paid users were allowed a previewer. With the video player, I aimed to keep it consistent with other video players common to cloud viewers. Users are familiar with the&nbsp;layout.</p>

<h2>Nav</h2>

<p>The nav I found to be a bit inconsistent and congested. I had a hard time discerning which icon did what, and was a bit overwhelmed with the amount of icons. I shifted the upgrade feature farthest right, so it remains unobtrusive to the user. I also separated the tasks and messages drop down into two separate features. They aren&#8217;t peas and carrots or <span class="caps">PB&amp;J.</span> Tasks and messages should be separated. Instead of wondering whether it is a message form a coworker or a task from the project manager, the user will know immediately. Simplification is sometimes confused with subtracting. In this case it means simplification meant adding an extra icon to eliminate a step for the&nbsp;user.</p>

<h3>Sub&nbsp;Nav</h3>

<p>I cleared the sub nav up by using a bit more padding and dropping the font- size. There is already a contrasting color for the sub nav and the visual hierarchy is established without using that big of a font. Slightly smaller font will work just as well and will create a bit more breathing room for the title of the document. I also eliminated the text next to the icons. I feel that icons should already communicate the function of the button. Granted this is highly dependent on the users, and some sort of A/B testing would be helpful to make the&nbsp;decision.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>The comment area was cluttered with links for various types of comments. The comment area shouldn&#8217;t be intimidating or hard to read! It should be helpful and fun. At Box, the commenting area is also used to assign tasks, perhaps on a document or a <span class="caps">TPS</span>&nbsp;report.</p>
