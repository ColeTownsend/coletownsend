          <h1>Mach 2000</h1>
        </header>
        <p>June 15, 1973 a large demonstration was held outside the <span class="caps">LIP</span> (pronounced “leap”) watch factory in Besançon, France.  The workers rallied under the phrase: “C’est possible: on fabrique, on vend, on se&nbsp;paie!”</p>

<blockquote><p>“It is possible: we make them, we sell them, we pay&nbsp;ourselves.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The factory was taken over by the workers and proceeded to be self managed. During the time, watches were shipped out under the cloaks of monks, who brought in the mail. In the first six weeks, they made revenue equivalent to half a normal&nbsp;year.</p>

<p>At the time, <span class="caps">LIP</span> was struggling. Sales were at an all time low. They needed an &#8216;A&#8217; player and a revolutionary product. It called for new methods of production; they dropped management by the wayside and focused on creating something radical. They not only sold a very unique watch, but they sold the idea of their movement. They appealed to the people, bucking the established order and starting&nbsp;new.</p>

<p>To catalyze their comeback, <span class="caps">LIP</span> hired several modernist designers, Tallon being one of them. He was a Renaissance Man, and had experience in many facets of design. It was perfect for what they wanted. He had the experience to make a design accessible and incorporate fresh ideas from outside the watchmaking design&nbsp;community.</p>

<p>With his help, the Mach 2000 was developed. A product of his liberal background in design, the watch is simple and functional, taking hints from modernist style. It is beautiful without being obtrusive. It is iconic for its deep inset face and brightly colored&nbsp;crown.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.coletownsend.com/content/LIP/lip-small.svg"></p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>The face features a black background with an off white bezel as well as tick marks. The minute and second hands match these. The hour hand is red, as well as the hour tick marks. It spans roughly a quarter of the diameter of the face. In contrast, the minute and second hands are half the diameter of the watch face. The two are differentiated by their&nbsp;width.</p>

<p>A red knob is used for the crown. It is three dimensional and red, contrasting the flat black of the watch casing. It is set in a cut out section of the upper right hand corner of the watch, making it easy to access when worn on the left&nbsp;wrist.</p>

<p>The design is simple, and echoes the spirit of the times: it&#8217;s simple lines and smooth features reflect the worker&#8217;s new energy and passion for the process. It&#8217;s asymmetric, departing from traditional watch&nbsp;forms.</p>

<p>When a product is made solely by  a group of designers and producers, without management, it often ends in a success. Look at Layervault, Karmaloop, and Square. They were all started with a designer at their core. I realize what I’m saying isn’t&nbsp;new.</p>

<p>That’s the&nbsp;point.</p>

<p>The watches made by <span class="caps">LIP</span> in 1974 were designed and produced by the designers and watchmakers with no outside influence. The operated under shut doors, in a highly collaborative fashion. They were operating in a highly stressful environment, their jobs and their livelihoods were on the line. They were forced to  change their methods in order to compete. The new method of development is now something that we often see. The entire process — design, production, and sale — is controlled by the same people. They are the ones who are passionate about the product, and therefore they can infuse their brand, their marketing, their product with this very passion. The result is a product with a rich personality and a unique&nbsp;design.</p>
