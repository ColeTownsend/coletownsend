<p><a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/" target="_blank">Sketch App</a> by Bohemian Coding is absolutely awesome. It’s built for UI work. It exclusively uses vectors. The interface is simple and intuitive. I can run it off a thumb drive and the program is smaller than the average PSD.</p>

<p>One area where Sketch lacks is resources. There are so many Photoshop plugins, grids, brushes, and templates. As the industry standard I would expect there to be more for Photoshop, just as Windows runs more games than Mac. That’s just how it is.</p>

<p>Even so, there are a surprising lack of downloads and addons. As there are devs that make games specifically for Mac, I would expect some designers to make resources specifically for Sketch. I didn’t find as many as I would like, so I took a few hours of my time to make The Royal Macs. It features a minimally styled iMac, iPad, and iPhone that are infinitely scalable. <a href="http://cl.ly/Nrmc" target="blank">You can download it here (opens in new tab).</a></p>

<p>I encourage you to give Sketch a try. The app is 10mb; neither slow download speed nor hard drive size is a good excuse.</p>

<p><em>Update: Since then, tons of awesome resources for Sketch have come out.</em>
