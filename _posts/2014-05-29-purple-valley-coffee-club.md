[Purple Valley Coffee](http://pvcc.twnsnd.co) is a school club I started to expose students, both familiar and unfamiliar to coffee and brewing, to new methods of production, different styles of beans, and some basic chemistry related to production. Students will learn how to make their own coffe, and will no longer rely on cafes.

I created this microsite as a way of organizing member sign up so I can update the constitution to reflect the current members as well as apply to Williams College Council for the appropriate ammount of funding.

It also serves as a base for information to increase transparency and drive membership and a place to document the experiences of the group. 

_This site is only accessible on Williams College wifi as it has student names. Better safe than sorry._
