## Summary
TheNews is a website and app that combines Hacker and Designer News. It's simple to quickly browse both, checking on the latest links, resources, and updates in the tech and web community. 

## TheNews.im
For the website, I wanted to create a bit more whitespace and increase the size of the text, to emphasize the content. I increased the base font size, shrank the number indicators, and increased the white space in each block. The size of each block was increased both to give room for the increased text size, but also to give the blocks a great individual presence, without becoming heavy and burdened by too much text.
