Typistry is a single column, reading-centric theme for Tumblr. I wanted to create an environment around the blog post, to coddle long form for a great reading experience. The end result was a theme that looked similar to what one might see on a kindle, on the NYT redesign, or on A List Apart.

## Reader Friendly
The goal of this design was to optimize legibility. I focused on the reading experience. I started by choosing a font, and establishing the font size, line height and paragraph width. When I sought out to choose a font, I looked for humanist serifs that I enjoyed reading. I visited the informationArchitects blog, A List Apart, took a look at my kindle, and typed a bit on ByWord. I found that I enjoyed the heavier weighted serifs on my Kindle and A List Apart. I dug through free font catalogs and searched in the Google Web Fonts repo. I stumbled across Lora. Lora has moderate contrast and a tall x-height â€” perfect for long form reading.

I then established a typographic rhythm. I used the Pearsonified typographic golden ratio calculator formula with the compute capabilities of SCSS. I established a body width of 620px and a large body font size. The end result was a good balance of line length, font size, and white space. 
 
## Using Sass
I utilized SCSS to style the theme. It was incredible how quickly and easily I could make vast style changes to the blog. Using @mixins was both faster for coding and better for visual consistency. As I made this theme responsive, as opposed to fluid, I changed elements as needed, which lead to less code. I ended up with cleaner CSS, and ultimately fewer changes to the formatting of the blog. Visually, it is consistent and it scales down gracefully to smartphone.
