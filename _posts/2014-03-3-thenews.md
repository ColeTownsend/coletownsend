## Summary
TheNews is a website and app that combines Hacker and Designer News. It's simple to quickly browse both, checking on the latest links, resources, and updates in the tech and web community. 

## TheNews.im
For the website, I wanted to create a bit more whitespace and increase the size of the text, to emphasize the content. I increased the base font size, shrank the number indicators, and increased the white space in each block. The size of each block was increased both to give room for the increased text size, but also to give the blocks a great individual presence, without becoming heavy and burdened by too much text.

## TheNews App
TheNews App for iOS is a translation of the website, optimized for the best mobile experience. It takes advantage of native gestures, as well as conditioned gestures to make for a clean, natural feeling experience. I was lucky enough to have a target user base that is experienced with gestures. Swiping the navigation bar at the top switches between Designer and Hacker News. Swiping a post from right to left takes the user to the comment thread. Swiping from left to right "up votes" the post.
