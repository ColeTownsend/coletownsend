<a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/" target="_blank">Sketch App</a> by Bohemian Coding is _the app_ for designing websites and interfaces. It's built for UI work. It exclusively uses vectors. The interface is simple and intuitive. It can run off a thumb drive and the program is smaller than the average PSD.

One area where Sketch lacks is resources. There are so many Photoshop plugins, grids, brushes, and templates. As the industry standard I would expect there to be more for Photoshop, just as Windows runs more games than Mac. That's just how it is.

Even so, there are a surprising lack of downloads and addons. As there are devs that make games specifically for Mac, I would expect some designers to make resources specifically for Sketch. I didn't find as many as I would like, so I took a few hours of my time to make The Royal Macs. It features a minimally styled iMac, iPad, and iPhone that are infinitely scalable. You can download it <a href="http://cl.ly/Nrmc" target="blank">here</a> (opens in new tab).

I encourage you to give Sketch a try. The app is 10mb; neither slow download speed nor hard drive size is a good excuse.

<em>Update: Since then, tons of awesome resources for Sketch have come out.</em>
