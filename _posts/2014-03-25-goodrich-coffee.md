At Williams College, I worked with Goodrich Coffee Bar. I developed their identity through several poster campaigns. With custom illustrations and cheeky copywriting I helped develop their brand voice. I used the typeface _Soleil_, available on Typekit.

###### Fall Campaign

</div>
<div>
{% include _fluidbox.html grid="2" class="" alt="Tees" url="gcb-iced.jpg" %}{% include _fluidbox.html grid="2" class="" alt="Tees" url="gcb-wildflour.jpg" %}
</div>


###### Winter Campaign
<div>
{% include _fluidbox.html grid="2" class="" alt="Tees" url="gcb-night.jpg" %}{% include _fluidbox.html grid="2" class="" alt="Tees" url="gcb-happy-tea.jpg" %}
