[Nomad](http://nomad.cool) package manager for Arduino. In three commands, you can get your device up and running within minutes using the most popular libraries on the internet. You can also easily package and share your own setup.

## Logo

The logo is an asymmetric tent with bright red hues with a deep purple stroke. It's meant to evoke the hunter-gatherer lifestyle of its namesake: fire, warmth, safety, mobility, and flexibility.

Initially, I played with the idea of camels, horses, and wood fires. I thought about working on a way to simplify the nomadic lifestyle: yurts, tents, constellations, rock paintings. What resonated the most with the name I felt was the tent. In just over an hour I had a working piece.

I sketched out several pages and found the most appealing to be the assymetric skewed towards the right. I didn't do any fancy golden ratio circles or grid setup for this.

## Web

The website needed to communicate both how to work Nomad while showing how easy the service is to use. The goal in mind was lightweight modularity â€” just how great code should be. It also needs approachability. While many users will be familiar with command line, they may not be familiar with package managers. I tried to differentiate this site from most code based sites, looking to simplify information and aesthetic flourishes. The result is a clear hierarchy, minimal copywriting, and ample whitespace as to not overwhelm visitors.
