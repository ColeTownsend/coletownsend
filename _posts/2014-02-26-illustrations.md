Illustration is something I enjoy doing, so I try to incorporate it where appropriate. I rely on simple shapes with some minor adjustments to create a piece, filling in smaller details as I see fit. It's topped off with a left skewed drop shadow.

Below are a selection of my favorite illustrations that I have recently done.
