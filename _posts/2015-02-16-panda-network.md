Panda Network is the bootstrapped co-founding duo of Ahmet Sulek and William Channer. They simply get things done. They work in collaboration with many different developers and designers to ship apps you may be familiar with. I was lucky enough to work through them on [TheNews]({{ site.baseurl }}/work/thenews), designing both the iOS app, iOS app landing page, and redesigning the web app.

## Getting Stuff Done
After enumerating over 3 different layouts, Ahmet, Williams and I decided on a simple and straightforward list. It speaks to their style of work. They're quick to reply, keep things moving, and stay organized. They also have a ton of projects off the ground. They're body of work really speaks for them, all they need is a place to invoke the various brands under the Panda Network umbrella.

This is a more basic but eye catching approach. It's straightforward and speaks directly to dev and designers. They have likely heard of what Panda Networks has done. The apps here can continually be added and instead tells a story of Panda's work.

The website also comes in a mobile flavor. It's styled according to work â€” so on mobile appears their mobile work available in the App Store.
