Panda Network is the bootstrapped co-founding duo of Ahmet Sulek and William Channer. They simply get things done. They work in collaboration with many different developers and designers to ship apps you may be familiar with. I was lucky enough to work through them on [TheNews]({{ site.baseurl }}/work/thenews), designing both the iOS app, iOS app landing page, and redesigning the web app.

## Getting Stuff Done

After mulling over 3 different layouts, Ahmet, Williams and I decided on a simple and straightforward list. It speaks to their style of work. They're quick to reply, keep things moving, and stay organized. They also have a ton of projects off the ground. Their body of work really speaks for them, all they need is a place to invoke the various brands under the Panda Network umbrella.

This is a more basic but eye catching approach. It's straightforward and speaks directly to developers and designers who have likely heard of what Panda Networks has created. Panda can continually add new works as well without destroying the design and it will only further reinforce their identity.

## Copywriting

After stumbling across the portfolios of a few copywriters, I noted how the ones I liked best and the ones that seemed the most effective were short and punchy. They were descriptive, but not flowery.

> Panda Network is a collaborative think tank created by Ahmet Sulek and William Channer. In the past they've worked with many talented developers and designers including Cole Townsend, Yagiz Nizipli, and Tosin Afolabi.

## Executing the Animation

I was impressed with Ahmet's execution on the part of the click and scale animation that I gave him a set of rudimentary keyframes for. He also added the springiness to the underlines, atmospheric bubbles, and the animated letters. The added animations were certainly welcome to the design. You can seem them at the live site — [panda.network](http://panda.network).

## Mobile

The website also comes in a mobile flavor. It's styled according to work per medium — when accessed on a mobile device, their latest apps available in the App Store appear.

Currently the website is optimized for a generic width starting at a minimum of 320px, and looks best on slightly larger more powerful devices due to the slightly resource intensive animation.
