## Logo

I developed the logo as well as business cards for the company. In the logo, I aimed to communicate trustworthiness, stability, and approachability. After many different sketches, I chose an off centered, three dimensional "T". A flat "T" seemed a bit boring, interchangeable, unapproachable. It didn't communicate the close relationship that Tuchuang aims to develop with clients. Adding a dimension and separating the sides gave it a bit of visual interest, while still communicating Tuchuang's professionalism, effectiveness, and strength. The end result is easily reproduced, visually consistent in all media, and scales perfectly. 

## Business Cards

With a template already in mind, I created a slightly more unique business card that would look great in both Chinese and English.

## Website

I provided the layout, illustrations, as well as CSS for various elements.
