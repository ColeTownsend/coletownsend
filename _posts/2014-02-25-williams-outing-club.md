The Williams Outing Club is responsible for connecting students with beautiful mountains, forests, and trail systems we have in the Purple Valley. They organize hikes, ski trips, lend equipment, and keep otherwise library bound students active. WOC highlights during the academic year include WOOLF (backpacking trips for incoming Frosh), Friday morning hikes, and Mountain Day. These all revolve around the surrounding Berkshire Mountains. In the current logo, WOC is juxtaposed against trees, but it doesn't quite seem unified nor emphasize the mountainous locale.

I was inspired to start working on this logo while procrastinating. I had an architecture project due in a few days, and wanted to be productive, but couldn't focus on the actual building. I set out to create a logotype that incorporated the environment and attitude of WOC.

I recently purchased [Sifonn](http://www.ultratypes.com/product/sifonn-pro), a beautiful display face with a ton of glyphs. The "W" of Sifonn is staggered, just like the mountains that overlap on the Purple Valley horizon.  I found a great balance between balanced geometric shapes that unified the outing club with the mountains. 

I bridged the remaining space with two lines, one continuing from the mountains, the other slightly cut off. These unify the logo, but don't serve any symbolic purpose. The real idea was to balance it, without detracting from the play of the W and the mountains.

I applied the logo in several different branding schemes to give an idea of how it might be used.
